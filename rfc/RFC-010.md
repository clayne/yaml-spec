RFC-010
=======

Documents after the first require a document-start-indicator

## Problem

YAML supports two document markers, `---` and `...`.
Their roles and usage is not entirely clear.
The YAML 1.2 spec refers to these as the "directives end" and the "document end" markers or indicators.
The YAML 1.1 spec referred to `---` as the "document start" marker.

## Proposal

The "directives end" marker should be renamed back to "document start", and be explicitly required when starting any document after the first in a stream.
The "document end" marker would continue to be optional, and useful far more rarely, e.g. when needing to include a directive between documents.

## Examples

OK:
```
doc 1
---
doc 2
...
%TAG ! !foo/
--- !bar
doc 3
```

Error:
```
doc 1
...
doc 2
```
