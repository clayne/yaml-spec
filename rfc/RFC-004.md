=======

Explicit-key-indicator not allowed in flow-mappings

## Synopsis

Target: 1.3

Status: 0

Tags: explicit flow key

[Discuss](../../issues/0)

## Problem

The explicit key indicator was meant for collection keys in block mappings.
It doesn't make sense in flow collections since the mappings can use the natural `{}` explicit syntax.

## Proposal

Disallow the explicit key indicator (`?`) in flow mappings.

## Examples

```
# NO
[ ? [4, 2]: 42 ]
# OK
[ { [4, 2]: 42 } ]
```
