RFC-003
=======

Single-pair-mappings with a collection-key in a flow-sequence must be explicit

## Synopsis

Target: 1.3

Status: 0

Tags: flow key mapping

[Discuss](../../issues/0)

## Problem

In YAML 1.2, Flow sequences support single pair mappings:
```
[ 1, 2, foo: bar ]
```

When the mapping key is a collection, there is an unbounded lookahead:
```
[ 1, 2, [...] ]
vs
[ 1, 2, [...]: bar ]
```

## Proposal

Single pair mappings must be explicitly defined with curly braces inside of flow sequences.

## Examples

```
# NO
[ [4, 2]: 42 ]
# OK
[ { [4, 2]: 42 } ]
```
