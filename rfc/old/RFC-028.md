# RFC-028 -- Forbid bare documents except the first

## Problem

Currently, after a document-end `...` you can start a bare document with content:

```
doc 1
...
doc 2
...
```

You can also add a comment and another document-end:

```
doc 1
...
# just a comment, no document
...
```

It's hard to think of use cases for this.

It has several disadvantages:

* Parsing is harder
* When creating a DOM which aims to keep everything (for roundtrip manipulation), then you have not only
document nodes, but also comment nodes.
  This adds complexity.

## Proposal

All documents in a stream except the first need an explicit document-start `---`.
The only need for using `...` should be when you want to add a directive or a comment before the document.

## Examples

```
doc 1
---
doc 2
---
doc 3
```

```
doc 1
...
# document 2 is following
---
doc 2
...
%TAG x y
---
doc 3
...
```

In this example, when creating a DOM, the comment will be part of the "document 2" node, just like a directive is part of the following document node.

After a document-end `...`, the only things allowed are comments, directives, and/or a document-start `---`.

One open question is, if we allow comments at the end of the stream, would this comment then also be part of the last document?

```
doc 1
...
# a comment
```

## Discussion

Edit: I retract this, as there are use cases for empty documents ~~ perlpunk
