# RFC-026 -- Allow double-quoted Block Scalar

## Problem

Block Scalars don't support escape sequences like `\n` or `\x0b`.
You have to use a double quoted multiline flow scalar instead.
Flow Scalars, however, are not as nice as Block Scalars regarding indendation/alignment.

## Proposal

Support `>"` and `|"`.

In such a Block Scalar, you would be allowed to use escape sequences, including the backslash at the
end to remove the folding space.

## Examples

```
---
folded: >"
  a long line that includes
  an escaped \t tab
flow: "a long line that includes an escaped \t tab"

---
# a long line you want to split but does not have spaces
folded: >-"
  word1\
  -word2\
  -word3
flow: "word1-word2-word3"

---
literal: |"
  Code that needs Carriage return, and you\r
  want to make it visible\r
flow: "Code that needs Carriage return, and you\r\nwant to make it visible\r\n"
```
