# RFC-014 -- Anchors always always come before tags when both

## Status

Proposed for 2.0.

## Proposal

Currently, anchors and tags can be in any order.
That is ugly to implement, and also logically incorrect.
A node with the tag represents the content, so they belong together.
An anchor refers to that.

## Proposed Changes

* If a node has both tag and anchor, the anchor must come first

## Examples

```yaml
# Not allowed:
--- !!int &anchor
23
# Allowed
--- &anchor !!int
23
```

Probably this would break too much, so this is proposed for 2.0
