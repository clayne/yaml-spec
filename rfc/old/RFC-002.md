RFC-002 -- Tighten rules regarding document header
==================================================

## Synopsis

Target: 1.3

Status: 0

Tags: document header tighten

[Discussion](../../../issues/0)


## Status

Proposed for 1.3.


## Problem

Top level scalars need to be obvious that they are encoded in YAML, otherwise any plain text is valid YAML.
Any plain text could contain syntax that includes 

Node properties a


## Proposal

The best way to make it clear that content is encoded as YAML is with a `---` header.

* All top level scalar nodes MUST use `---`.
* All top level nodes that have properties MUST use `---`.
* Properties MUST follow `---` on the same line for top level nodes that have them.

## Examples


## Problems

If we want to keep strict JSON compatability, we need to allow for top level scalars that are double quoted strings, number, or the values `true`, `false`, `null`.

YAML 1.2 came out during the time when only JSON objects and arrays were allowed at the top level.
We could keep that restriction in YAML 1.3.
