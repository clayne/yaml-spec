RFC-000
=======

Empty-scalars not allowed as keys

## Synopsis

Target: 1.3

Status: 0

Tags: empty key scalar

[Discuss](../../issues/0)

## Problem

YAML 1.2 allows "nothing" to be a valid value; a plain empty scalar that often is loaded as a null value.

This means that `:` is same as `null: null`.

The null value isn't very useful as a mapping key, and using an empty value to specify it is problematic to the language.

## Proposal

Disallow plain empty scalars as mapping keys.

## Examples

```
# NO
: foo

{ : foo }

# OK
null: foo
"": foo
! '': foo
```
