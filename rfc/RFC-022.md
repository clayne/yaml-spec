RFC-022
=======

Plain-scalars cannot end with a colon character

## Synopsis

Target: 1.3

Status: 0

Tags: ...

[Discuss](../../issues/0)

## Problem

In Flow style, it can look ambiguous:
```
{foo:}
```

Generally, any YAML node should be able to be moved around, for example
if a linter wants to line up all keys and values in a mapping:

```
a: value
bc: value
cde: value
defg:: value
```

and suddenly this becomes invalid:

```
a     : value
bc    : value
cde   : value
defg: : value
```

## Proposal

Forbid colons at the end of plain scalars.

## Examples


Ok:
```
"key:": value
```

Error:
```
key:: value
```
