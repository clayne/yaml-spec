RFC-001
=======

Flow collections as block mapping keys must be explicit

## Synopsis

Target: 1.3

Status: 0

Tags: block explicit flow key mapping

[Discuss](../../issues/0)

## Problem

Implicit flow collections currently require an unbounded look-ahead, since they may or may not be mapping keys.
A parser must check for a colon after the collection has terminated.

YAML 1.2 imposes a 1024 character limit if the collection is intended to become a key.

This is an poor solution and places too much burden on parser implementations.

## Proposal

Block mapping keys that are flow collections must be explicitly marked as such with the `?` indicator.

This removes the look-ahead entirely.

## Examples

```
# NO
[4, 2]: 42

# OK
? [4, 2]
: 42
```
